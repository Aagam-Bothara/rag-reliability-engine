Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and grounded responses.

RAG systems work by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base, then using those documents as context for a language model to generate answers. This approach significantly reduces hallucination compared to using language models alone.

The main components of a RAG system include a document store for storing the knowledge base, a retriever for finding relevant documents, and a generator for producing answers. The retriever typically uses both keyword-based search (like BM25) and semantic vector search for hybrid retrieval.

Quality assurance in RAG systems involves checking retrieval quality, verifying that generated answers are grounded in the evidence, and detecting contradictions between sources. A well-designed RAG system will abstain from answering when the evidence is insufficient rather than risk providing incorrect information.

Common challenges in RAG include chunk size optimization, handling multi-hop questions that require information from multiple sources, and maintaining low latency while performing thorough quality checks. Cross-encoder reranking can significantly improve retrieval quality by scoring query-document pairs more accurately than initial retrieval methods.
